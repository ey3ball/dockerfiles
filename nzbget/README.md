This is an attempt at building a clean nzbget image.

Clean as in "unbloated with build dependencies or unecessary clutter"

This is mostly an experiment, it appears that docker makes it especially hard
to produce lightweight images. Forget about having a simple Dockerfile with an
automatic build on docker hub.

My main purpose here is to explore the current limitations of docker /
Dockerfiles / docker hub.
